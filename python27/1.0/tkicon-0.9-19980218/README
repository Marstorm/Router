The tkIcon module allows you to change the Windows program icon from
within a running Tkinter program.

This binary release works with the PY14 kit that's also available from
our site.  Full sources will be provided at a later time.

For details on how to use this module, see the test code in the
tkIcon.py module, and the imageView demo program.
