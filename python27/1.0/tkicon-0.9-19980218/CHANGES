980218/fl -- added support for RGBA images (A=0 means transparent)

980218/fl -- up and running.  modified to take bitmap and mask as
string arguments.  supports P with optional transparency, and RGB
images.  the image is always resized to 64x64 pixels using nearest
neighbour resampling, and installed as both the small (window) and the
large icon (alt-tab process bar).

980203/fl -- created.  the test program was broken, so I never
realized that the code was actually working.
